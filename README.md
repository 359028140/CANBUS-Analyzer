# CANBUS-Analyzer
A development tool / companion software for Scan My Tesla. Graphs, displays and analyzes both known and unknown CANBUS packets.

CANBUS-Analyzer was inspired by comma.ai Cabana, but I wanted the same possibilities with my own data and formulas. 
To learn how to reverse engineer CANBUS data, see comma.ai's tutorials!

Plotting is done by OxyPlot library, which has some great, but very hard to find keyboard and mouse shortcuts:

Short summary: Scroll = zoom, scroll on an axis = zoom 1 axis. Click the plot window + press HOME to reset all axis.
